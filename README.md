# 📊 Power BI Dashboards

This repository is a collection of **Power BI projects** that I am building while studying and practicing Business Intelligence.  
Each dashboard is designed to apply data modeling, DAX, and visualization techniques to real or sample datasets.  

The goal of this repo is to serve as a **portfolio hub**, where I will keep adding new dashboards as I progress in my learning journey.
